# CYK Implementation Project

I have been part of this programming project in which the CKY algorithm is implemented using Dynamic Programing. The algorithm takes as an argument a Context Free Grammar and a word. The objective of the algorithm is to determine if the word (or phrase) is part of the grammar. Furthermore, the Probabilistic CKY is also implemented, and returns which rules the word is most likely to come from. In addition, it generates a tree to visualize how the phrase has been formed following the rules.

The project dates from May 2023 and requieres aptittudes such as Dynamic Programing, python and knowledge about formal language with Context Free Grammars, the Chompsky Normal Form and the CKY algorithm for word-grammar recongition, which is implemented in this project.
